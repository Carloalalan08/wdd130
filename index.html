      <p>Hello! My name is Mon Carlo Alalan. I am from Baler, Aurora, Philippines, and  I have a passion for
         playing basketball and watching anime. When I am not studying, you can usually find me at our backyard, 
         cleaning and running errands. I am currently a student in the WDD 130 course, where I am exploring 
         the fascinating world of web development. I am eager to build creative, functional websites and use my 
         skills to bring ideas to life online.

         Feel free to browse this site and connect with me. I would love to hear from you!</p>
